However, it is still under-explored in early childhood education (ECE) since the AI curriculum for young children has just been designed in recent years. A scoping review was conducted to examine the thematic and content analysis of 16 empirical papers from 2016 to 2022. This scoping reviews evaluate, synthesize, and display 16 studies on AI literacy in early childhood education, including curriculum design, AI tools, pedagogical approaches, research designs, assessment methods, and findings. The discussion of the AI literacy implementation in ECE contributes to providing references for educators and researchers to design interventions to engage young children in AI learning. Further, we identified a set of challenges and opportunities of AI literacy. Several challenges included (1) lack of teachers' AI knowledge, skills, and confidence; (2) lack of curriculum design; and (3) lack of teaching guidelines. Although educators meet challenges at the beginning stage of developing AI instructional design for young children, AI learning could bring learning opportunities and foster young children's AI literacy in terms of AI concepts, practices and perspectives. We foresee that there will be a growing number of age-appropriate curriculum and tools for the ECE level. At the end, we also make some recommendations for future researchers and educators to improve AI literacy research and learning design in early childhood education.",2024-05-31 08:46:22,100124,,,4.0,Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy in Early Childhood Education,ScienceDirect,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davy-Tsz-Kit-Ng/publication/367064159_Artificial_intelligence_AI_literacy_in_early_childhood_education_The_challenges_and_opportunities/links/63f8a30db1704f343f7c7698/Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Literacy-in-Early-Childhood-Education-The-Challenges-and-Opportunities.pdf

Technological resources (especially computers) have been integrated in education for decades. However, integration of educational technology in early childhood education is a more recent trend compared to the other levels of education. This fact creates the need to develop, apply and study application of resources and methodologies specifically addressed to young children. Artificial Intelligence approaches have been incorporated to educational technology resources providing improved interaction to learners. In this paper, Artificial Intelligence methods exploited in the context of early childhood educational technology are surveyed. The discussion mainly concerns computer-based learning systems incorporating intelligent methods (e.g., Intelligent Tutoring and Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems) and educational robots addressed to early childhood. To the best of the author’s knowledge, such issues have not been thoroughly discussed till now in literature.",2024-05-31 08:49:32,169-199,,,,,Springer Link,

This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world.",2024-05-31 10:35:34,100061,,,3.0,Artificial Intelligence education for young children,ScienceDirect,

Applications of AI transform the tools of education. AI has a variety of educational applications, such as personalized learning platforms to promote students’ learning, automated assessment systems to aid teachers, and facial recognition systems to generate insights about learners’ behaviors. Despite the potential benefits of AI to support students’ learning experiences and teachers’ practices, the ethical and societal drawbacks of these systems are rarely fully considered in K-12 educational contexts. The ethical challenges of AI in education must be identified and introduced to teachers and students. To address these issues, this paper (1) briefly defines AI through the concepts of machine learning and algorithms; (2) introduces applications of AI in educational settings and benefits of AI systems to support students’ learning processes; (3) describes ethical challenges and dilemmas of using AI in education; and (4) addresses the teaching and understanding of AI by providing recommended instructional resources from two providers—i.e., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Media Lab and Code.org.

It is critical to develop the next generation's AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students' learning.

The validity and reliability of the AI4KG assessment were evaluated by experts, with Cronbach’s <i>α</i> and Item Response Theory approach. The results demonstrated that the AI literacy assessment (AI4KGA) was valid and reliable. We also found that younger children scored lower on the AI literacy assessment than older children and girls demonstrated a slightly higher AI literacy score than boys after they completed the AI4KG curriculum. The AI4KGA has potential applications for various stakeholders, such as policymakers, educators, instructional designers, researchers, and educational institutions. The findings suggest that the AI4KGA can evaluate children’s learning outcomes in terms of AI literacy. Overall, this research contributes to developing AI literacy assessment in kindergarten children and advancing AI literacy education.<br />",2024-06-10 06:57:40,1-21,,,,,EBSCOhost,
journalArticle,2024.0,"Su, Jiahong",Kindergarten Teachers’ Perceptions of AI Literacy Education for Young Children,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,10.1007/s10798-024-09876-8,,"Educators and researchers have increasingly recognized the importance of AI literacy. Despite the growing body of AI literacy literature, the challenges and enablers for introducing AI literacy for kindergarten children is still underexplored and undertheorized in early childhood education. It is critical to understand the challenges and enablers associated with promoting AI literacy and perceptions in kindergartens needs to be further researched and evaluated. This study aims to identify teachers’ views on the importance of AI literacy in kindergartens and the challenges and enablers of promoting AI literacy in kindergartens. Data was collected from 15 teachers through individual interviews. It was found that the four main challenges of promoting AI literacy in kindergarten classrooms, including lack of school support, lack of children’s comprehensive ability, insufficient teacher knowledge of AI, and lack of curriculum guidelines. The three main enablers of promoting AI literacy in kindergarten classrooms are government support, school support, and social needs. We also found that more than half of teachers in this study considered AI literacy education is crucial for kindergarten children. This study develops an AI literacy policy framework for young children that includes three dimensions—governance, pedagogical, and operational and management. Based on the findings, suggestions for educators, curriculum developers, policymakers, and researchers are discussed.<br />",2024-06-10 06:57:40,1-21,,,,,EBSCOhost,

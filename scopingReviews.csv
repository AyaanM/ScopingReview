A scoping review was conducted to examine the thematic and content analysis of 16 empirical papers from 2016 to 2022. This scoping reviews evaluate, synthesize, and display 16 studies on AI literacy in early childhood education, including curriculum design, AI tools, pedagogical approaches, research designs, assessment methods, and findings. The discussion of the AI literacy implementation in ECE contributes to providing references for educators and researchers to design interventions to engage young children in AI learning. Further, we identified a set of challenges and opportunities of AI literacy. Several challenges included (1) lack of teachers' AI knowledge, skills, and confidence; (2) lack of curriculum design; and (3) lack of teaching guidelines. Although educators meet challenges at the beginning stage of developing AI instructional design for young children, AI learning could bring learning opportunities and foster young children's AI literacy in terms of AI concepts, practices and perspectives. We foresee that there will be a growing number of age-appropriate curriculum and tools for the ECE level. At the end, we also make some recommendations for future researchers and educators to improve AI literacy research and learning design in early childhood education.","2023-01-01","2024-05-31 08:46:22","2024-06-03 10:37:29","2024-05-31 08:46:22","100124","","","4","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy in Early Childhood Education","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/SPBM9Y3T/Su et al. - 2023 - Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy in Early Chi.pdf; ; /Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/T2T2PYIW/S2666920X23000036.html","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davy-Tsz-Kit-Ng/publication/367064159_Artificial_intelligence_AI_literacy_in_early_childhood_education_The_challenges_and_opportunities/links/63f8a30db1704f343f7c7698/Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Literacy-in-Early-Childhood-Education-The-Challenges-and-Opportunities.pdf","","Early childhood education; AI; AI education; AI literacy; Challenges and opportunities; Learning and teaching AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, integration of educational technology in early childhood education is a more recent trend compared to the other levels of education. This fact creates the need to develop, apply and study application of resources and methodologies specifically addressed to young children. Artificial Intelligence approaches have been incorporated to educational technology resources providing improved interaction to learners. In this paper, Artificial Intelligence methods exploited in the context of early childhood educational technology are surveyed.

This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world.","2022-01-01","2024-05-31 10:35:34","2024-05-31 10:35:34","2024-05-31 10:35:34","100061","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","Artificial Intelligence education for young children","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Early childhood education; AI literacy; Artificial intelligence education; Digital equity; Pedagogical considerations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroplasticity in toddlers refers to the brain’s ability to change and adapt remarkably during early childhood. A child’s future can be significantly impacted based on the cognitive, emotional, and motor development during the early stage. Therefore, it is imperative to train children aged 1 to 4 with appropriate care and provide them with a more personalized learning experience, depending on their progress. Toddlers' development of hand and eye movement, facial expressions, rhythms, rhymes, etc., occurs when they play traditional games like pat-a-cake or peek-a-boo at daycares or preschools. Their progress is tracked based on factors such as language development, social and emotional development, working habits, eating habits, personality development, etc. However, carrying out the exercises and monitoring each child's development in situations where many kids are present is challenging. These toddlers need a more individualized approach as the development of every child is different. Immersive technology is currently used in personalized learning using artificial intelligence and IoT sensors like motion and audio sensors. To apply this technology, this study uses AI-integrated smart toys with sensors to engage children in various activities. This will assist individualized learning through personalizing experiences according to every child's requirement, offering possibilities. A systematic design process was followed to determine the challenges in this area, development in children, activities that affect their development, and technology use. A design concept has been proposed after following the double-diamond design process. The suggested design result uses technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT sensors, microphones, face detection cameras, and a dashboard reflecting data collected by the smart toy and processed using AI analytics to track the child’s development.","2024","2024-05-31 11:46:46","2024-05-31 11:46:46","","265-275","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Sharma, Harish; Shrivastava, Vivek; Tripathi, Ashish Kumar; Wang, Lipo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global education systems are leaning towards a more personalized, student-centered approach. Innovations like Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given the modern-day technology to accommodate the distinctive features of human beings - smart machines and computers have been built to understand individual-specific needs. This opens an avenue for “personalization” in the education sector. From, mushrooming of Education Technology (EdTech) start-ups to government funding in AI research, it is evident that the next generation educational reforms would take a quantum leap forward piloted by Big Data analysis and AI. The objective of this paper is to organize the vast literature on the use of AI for personalization of education and to shed light on the key themes by which an AI-driven approach makes structural modifications to the existing education system. To this effect, the paper employed a systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop natural language processing model of past two years' literature (2019–2021) in English language from IEEE Xplore on countries China, India and the USA. This process yielded more than 2000 search results at first and these were eventually shortlisted to 353 relevant papers for in-depth analysis. Being the pioneers in EdTech innovations, insights from research done in these three countries provides valuable input for the development of global education systems and research. The findings bring forward AI's success in catering to specific learning requirements, learning habits, and learning abilities of students and guiding them into optimized learning paths across all three countries. Not just that, it is also evident from the literature that AI augments educational content, customizes it for any individual according to their needs, and raises the flag of caution for anticipated learning difficulties. This recalibrates the role of instructors as well as optimizes the teaching-learning environment for a better learning experience. The upward trajectory of educational development with AI opens a new horizon of personalized education for the future generation, but also comes with its challenges. Data privacy issues, availability of digital resources, and affordability constraints have been reported in the recent literature as impediments in the way of promoting such technologies for day-to-day practice.","2022-01-01","2024-05-31 12:09:27","2024-05-31 12:09:27","2024-05-31 12:09:27","100068","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","Personalized education and Artificial Intelligence in the United States, China, and India","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Big data; China; India; Personalized education; USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, 46 studies in academic conferences and journals are reviewed to investigate pedagogical strategies, learning tools, assessment methods in AI literacy education in K-12 contexts, and students’ learning outcomes. The investigation reveals that the promotion of AI literacy education has seen significant progress in the past two decades. This highlights that intelligent agents, including Google’s Teachable Machine, Learning ML, and Machine Learning for Kids, are age-appropriate tools for AI literacy education in K-12 contexts. Kindergarten students can benefit from learning tools such as PopBots, while software devices, such as Scratch and Python, which help to develop the computational thinking of AI algorithms, can be introduced to both primary and secondary schools. The research shows that project-based, human–computer collaborative learning and play- and game-based approaches, with constructivist methodologies, have been applied frequently in AI literacy education. Cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes, course satisfaction and soft skills acquisition have been reported.

This study proposes and validates a comprehensive AI literacy assessment tool (AI4KGA) for kindergarten children. The research involved 215 children and 19 experts. The validity and reliability of the AI4KG assessment were evaluated by experts, with Cronbach’s <i>α</i> and Item Response Theory approach. The results demonstrated that the AI literacy assessment (AI4KGA) was valid and reliable. We also found that younger children scored lower on the AI literacy assessment than older children and girls demonstrated a slightly higher AI literacy score than boys after they completed the AI4KG curriculum.

In K-12 education, students harness AI technologies to acquire scientific knowledge, ranging from automated personalized virtual scientific inquiry to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Sora, and Google Bard. These AI technologies inherit various strengths and limitations in facilitating students’ engagement in scientific activities. There is a lack of framework to develop K-12 students’ epistemic considerations of the interaction between the disciplines of AI and science when they engage in producing, revising, and critiquing scientific knowledge using AI technologies. To accomplish this, we conducted a systematic review for studies that implemented AI technologies in science education. Employing the family resemblance approach as our analytical framework, we examined epistemic insights into relationships between science and AI documented in the literature. Our analysis centered on five distinct categories: aims and values, methods, practices, knowledge, and social–institutional aspects. Notably, we found that only three studies mentioned epistemic insights concerning the interplay between scientific knowledge and AI knowledge. Building upon these findings, we propose a unifying framework that can guide future empirical studies, focusing on three key elements: (a) AI’s application in science and (b) the similarities and (c) differences in epistemological approaches between science and AI. We then conclude our study by proposing a development trajectory for K-12 students’ learning of AI-science epistemic insights.<br />","2024-03-15","2024-06-03 08:42:34","2024-06-03 08:42:34","","1-31","","","","","Science & Education: Contributions from History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science and Mathematics","Unpacking Epistemic Insights of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Science Education","","","","","","","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; Epistemic insights; Family resemblance approach; Science education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study introduces a model for enhancing games and optimizing data analysis within the context of early childhood education (ECE) majors, hinging on deep learning (DL). This approach aims to enhance the quality of instruction provided to ECE majors and refine the effectiveness of their professional pursuits. This study commences by examining the incorporation of DL technologies within the domain of ECE and delving into their fundamental underpinnings. Subsequently, it expounds upon the design philosophy underpinning ECE games operating within the framework of DL. Finally, it outlines the game improvement and data analysis (GIADA) model tailored to ECE majors. This model is constructed upon DL technology and further refined through the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Empirical findings corroborate that the DL-CNN GIADA model achieves data analysis accuracy ranging from 83 to 93% across four datasets, underscoring the pronounced optimization prowess bestowed by CNN within the DL-based GIADA model. This study stands as an invaluable reference for the application and evolution of artificial intelligence technology within the realm of education, thereby contributing substantively to the broader landscape of educational advancement.","2023-11-20","2024-06-10 04:52:47","2024-06-10 04:52:47","","20273","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37985677 PMCID: PMC10662176","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/EKGZ8TZZ/Zhao et al. - 2023 - Optimization of the game improvement and data anal.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37985677","","Artificial Intelligence; Child, Preschool; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second, the prevention of school failure, is very topical today. By analysing these examples in their historicity, taking into account social, political, economical and scientific contexts, it becomes clear that early childhood education can contribute to the individualisation and decontextualisation of social problems. Yet acknowledging this also means opening windows of new opportunities, as far as the construction of social problems remains an open debate in which disagreement rather than consensus is fostered.","2010","2024-06-10 05:52:41","2024-06-10 05:52:41","2024-06-10 05:52:41","139-153","","2","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis, Ltd.","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/X22448VR/Vandenbroeck et al. - 2010 - The Social and Political Construction of Early Chi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Area studies programs such as Latin American & Caribbean Studies are invaluable in creating avenues that underscore the global range of experiences of historically underrepresented populations.

However, questions remain about the strength of the association between parenting and child EFs, more specifically which parental behaviours are most strongly associated with child EFs, and whether there is a critical period in early childhood during which parental behaviour is more influential. A meta-analysis was therefore conducted to determine the strength of the relation between various parental behaviours and EFs in children aged 0 to 8 years. We identified 42 studies published between 2000 and 2016, with an average of 12.77 months elapsing in the measurement of parent and child variables. Parental behaviours were categorised as positive (e.g. warmth, responsiveness, sensitivity), negative (e.g. control, intrusiveness, detachment) and cognitive (e.g. autonomy support, scaffolding, cognitive stimulation). Results revealed significant associations (ps < .001) between composite EF and positive (r = .25), negative (r = -.22) and cognitive (r = .20) parental behaviours. Associations between cognitive parental behaviours and EFs were significantly moderated by child age, with younger children showing a stronger effect size, whereas positive and negative parental behaviours showed a stable association with EFs across ages.

The inquiry is motivated by a fundamental question posed to educators: how best to cultivate AI literacies and competencies and how these proficiencies are structured and influenced. Employing a rigorous two-part methodology, the initial phase scrutinises 28 studies from the SCOPUS database, unveiling five distinct discourses germane to AI literacy. Subsequently, the second phase involves the administration of questionnaires to 73 students, whose responses undergo thematic analysis to discern patterns within the four domains delineated by Ng et al. The ensuing discourse underscores a pivotal revelation: despite formal adherence to established discourses, the conceptualisation of AI literacy necessitates a departure from conventional perspectives. Ethical principles, elucidated by students, emerge not merely as individual components but as integral facets of a broader societal literacy profile, thereby advocating a paradigm shift towards social reflection. This novel insight prompts a critical re-evaluation of AI literacy's prevailing assumptions and conceptual frameworks, urging a transition towards models grounded in ecological or network dynamic interactionist principles.","2024-03-01","2024-06-10 06:24:47","2024-06-10 06:24:47","","129","","3","13","","Social Sciences (2076-0760)","University Students' Conceptualisation of AI Literacy","","","","","","","eng","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: MDPI","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/34UUIM58/Černý - 2024 - University Students' Conceptualisation of AI Liter.pdf","","","ARTIFICIAL intelligence; COLLEGE students; DATABASES; INTERORGANIZATIONAL networks; LITERACY; THEMATIC analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These AI technologies inherit various strengths and limitations in facilitating students’ engagement in scientific activities. There is a lack of framework to develop K-12 students’ epistemic considerations of the interaction between the disciplines of AI and science when they engage in producing, revising, and critiquing scientific knowledge using AI technologies. To accomplish this, we conducted a systematic review for studies that implemented AI technologies in science education. Employing the family resemblance approach as our analytical framework, we examined epistemic insights into relationships between science and AI documented in the literature. Our analysis centered on five distinct categories: aims and values, methods, practices, knowledge, and social–institutional aspects. Notably, we found that only three studies mentioned epistemic insights concerning the interplay between scientific knowledge and AI knowledge. Building upon these findings, we propose a unifying framework that can guide future empirical studies, focusing on three key elements: (a) AI’s application in science and (b) the similarities and (c) differences in epistemological approaches between science and AI.

The launch of the ChatGPT-3 posed great challenges for higher education, given its popularity among university students. The present study aimed to analyze the attitudes of university students toward the use of ChatGPTs in their academic activities. Method: This study was oriented toward a quantitative approach and had a nonexperimental design. An online survey was administered to the 499 participants. Results: The findings of this study revealed a significant association between various factors and attitudes toward the use of the ChatGPT. The higher beta coefficients for responsible use (β=0.806***), the intention to use frequently (β=0.509***), and acceptance (β=0.441***) suggested that these are the strongest predictors of a positive attitude toward ChatGPT. The presence of positive emotions (β=0.418***) also plays a significant role. Conversely, risk (β=-0.104**) and boredom (β=-0.145**) demonstrate a negative yet less decisive influence.

The inquiry is motivated by a fundamental question posed to educators: how best to cultivate AI literacies and competencies and how these proficiencies are structured and influenced. Employing a rigorous two-part methodology, the initial phase scrutinises 28 studies from the SCOPUS database, unveiling five distinct discourses germane to AI literacy. Subsequently, the second phase involves the administration of questionnaires to 73 students, whose responses undergo thematic analysis to discern patterns within the four domains delineated by Ng et al. The ensuing discourse underscores a pivotal revelation: despite formal adherence to established discourses, the conceptualisation of AI literacy necessitates a departure from conventional perspectives. Ethical principles, elucidated by students, emerge not merely as individual components but as integral facets of a broader societal literacy profile, thereby advocating a paradigm shift towards social reflection.

An exhaustive summary of current evidence with examples is illustrated in this book, as well as cutting-edge research that serves as an AI literacy model for different countries'contexts. Part I, “Conceptualizing AI literacy”, provides a detailed discussion on the development of the concepts and frameworks on AI literacy education, discusses the differences and similarities between AI in education (AIED) and AI literacy education, and illustrates the reasons why K-16 students need to learn AI. These concepts are brought together in Part II, “K-16 AI literacy education” to further summarize the pedagogies, learning content, learning tools and assessment methods to inform K-16educators how to design their AI instruction at each education level. After that, part III “AI literacy for instructional designers” explores how instructional designers (i.e., AI developers and teachers) prepare themselves to become ready to design developmentally appropriate tools, platforms, services and curricula to empower students with AI literacy skills.","2022-01-01","2024-06-10 06:50:48","2024-06-10 06:50:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Cham","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence--Study and teaching; Computer literacy--Study and teaching; COMPUTERS / Artificial Intelligence / General; EDUCATION / General; EDUCATION / Teacher Training & Certification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Debugging techniques, which comprise fault localization and program repair, are an important part of the software development lifecycle for ensuring the quality of software systems. As the scale and complexity of software systems grow, developers intend to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of software debugging via artificial intelligence (artificial intelligence for software debugging, AI4SD). On the other hand, many artificial intelligence models are being integrated into safety-critical areas such as autonomous driving, image recognition, and audio processing, where software debugging is highly necessary and urgent (software debugging for artificial intelligence, SD4AI). An AI-enhanced debugging technique could assist in debugging AI systems more effectively, and a more robust and reliable AI approach could further guarantee and support debugging techniques. Therefore, it is important to take AI4SD and SD4AI into consideration comprehensively. In this paper, we want to show readers the path, the trend, and the potential that these two directions interact with each other. We select and review a total of 165 papers in AI4SD and SD4AI for answering three research questions, and further analyze opportunities and challenges as well as suggest future directions of this cross-cutting area.","2024-04-01","2024-06-10 06:50:48","2024-06-10 06:50:48","","1-43","","4","67","","SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences","When debugging encounters artificial intelligence","","","","","","","eng","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond applying AI in daily life applications and educational tools, understanding how to learn and teach AI is increasingly important. Despite these emerging technology breakthroughs, AI learning is still new to educators especially to K-16 teachers. There is a lack of evidence-based studies that inform them about AI learning, including design principles for building a set of curriculum content, and pedagogical approaches as well as technological tools. Teaching AI concepts and techniques from programming languages and developmentally appropriate learning tools (e.g., robotics, serious games, software, intelligent agents) across different education levels emerged in recent years. The primary purpose of this book is to respond to the need to conceptualize the emerging term “AI literacy” and investigate how toteach and learn AI in K-16 education settings.This book examines different aspects of learning artefacts, pedagogies, content knowledge and assessment methods of AI literacy education, from theoretical discussions to practical recommendations for curriculum and instructional design. An exhaustive summary of current evidence with examples is illustrated in this book, as well as cutting-edge research that serves as an AI literacy model for different countries'contexts. Part I, “Conceptualizing AI literacy”, provides a detailed discussion on the development of the concepts and frameworks on AI literacy education, discusses the differences and similarities between AI in education (AIED) and AI literacy education, and illustrates the reasons why K-16 students need to learn AI. These concepts are brought together in Part II, “K-16 AI literacy education” to further summarize the pedagogies, learning content, learning tools and assessment methods to inform K-16educators how to design their AI instruction at each education level. After that, part III “AI literacy for instructional designers” explores how instructional designers (i.e., AI developers and teachers) prepare themselves to become ready to design developmentally appropriate tools, platforms, services and curricula to empower students with AI literacy skills.","2022-01-01","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Cham","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence--Study and teaching; Computer literacy--Study and teaching; COMPUTERS / Artificial Intelligence / General; EDUCATION / General; EDUCATION / Teacher Training & Certification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inquiry is motivated by a fundamental question posed to educators: how best to cultivate AI literacies and competencies and how these proficiencies are structured and influenced. Employing a rigorous two-part methodology, the initial phase scrutinises 28 studies from the SCOPUS database, unveiling five distinct discourses germane to AI literacy. Subsequently, the second phase involves the administration of questionnaires to 73 students, whose responses undergo thematic analysis to discern patterns within the four domains delineated by Ng et al. The ensuing discourse underscores a pivotal revelation: despite formal adherence to established discourses, the conceptualisation of AI literacy necessitates a departure from conventional perspectives. Ethical principles, elucidated by students, emerge not merely as individual components but as integral facets of a broader societal literacy profile, thereby advocating a paradigm shift towards social reflection. This novel insight prompts a critical re-evaluation of AI literacy's prevailing assumptions and conceptual frameworks, urging a transition towards models grounded in ecological or network dynamic interactionist principles.","2024-03-01","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","129","","3","13","","Social Sciences (2076-0760)","University Students' Conceptualisation of AI Literacy","","","","","","","eng","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: MDPI","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/8KUTTLY4/Černý - 2024 - University Students' Conceptualisation of AI Liter.pdf","","","ARTIFICIAL intelligence; COLLEGE students; DATABASES; INTERORGANIZATIONAL networks; LITERACY; THEMATIC analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes and validates a comprehensive AI literacy assessment tool (AI4KGA) for kindergarten children. The research involved 215 children and 19 experts. The validity and reliability of the AI4KG assessment were evaluated by experts, with Cronbach’s <i>α</i> and Item Response Theory approach. The results demonstrated that the AI literacy assessment (AI4KGA) was valid and reliable. We also found that younger children scored lower on the AI literacy assessment than older children and girls demonstrated a slightly higher AI literacy score than boys after they completed the AI4KG curriculum. The AI4KGA has potential applications for various stakeholders, such as policymakers, educators, instructional designers, researchers, and educational institutions. The findings suggest that the AI4KGA can evaluate children’s learning outcomes in terms of AI literacy. Overall, this research contributes to developing AI literacy assessment in kindergarten children and advancing AI literacy education.<br />","2024-05-04","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","1-21","","","","","Education and Information Technologies: The Official Journal of the IFIP Technical Committee on Education","","","","","","","","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Place: New York Publisher: Springer US","","","","","AI literacy; AI literacy assessment; AI literacy education; AI4KGA; Early childhood education; Kindergarten children; Validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, more research must examine how teachers and educators perceive and experience these AI systems when implemented. Objectives: The first objective was to investigate informants' perceptions and experiences of AI-empowered interventions for children with autism. Mainly, it explores the informants' perceived benefits and challenges of using AI-empowered interventions and their recommendations for avoiding the perceived challenges. Methodology: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used. Twenty educators and parents with experience implementing AI interventions for autism were recruited through purposive sampling. Semi-structured and focus group interviews conducted, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: The analysis identified four major themes: perceived benefits of AI interventions, implementation challenges, needed support, and recommendations for improvement. Benefits included increased engagement and personalized learning. Challenges included technology issues, training needs, and data privacy concerns. Conclusions: AI-powered interventions show potential to improve autism support, but significant challenges must be addressed to ensure effective implementation from an educator's perspective. The benefits of personalized learning and student engagement demonstrate the potential value of these technologies. However, with adequate training, technical support, and measures to ensure data privacy, many educators will likely find integrating AI systems into their daily practices easier.

In K-12 education, students harness AI technologies to acquire scientific knowledge, ranging from automated personalized virtual scientific inquiry to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Sora, and Google Bard. These AI technologies inherit various strengths and limitations in facilitating students’ engagement in scientific activities. There is a lack of framework to develop K-12 students’ epistemic considerations of the interaction between the disciplines of AI and science when they engage in producing, revising, and critiquing scientific knowledge using AI technologies. To accomplish this, we conducted a systematic review for studies that implemented AI technologies in science education. Employing the family resemblance approach as our analytical framework, we examined epistemic insights into relationships between science and AI documented in the literature. Our analysis centered on five distinct categories: aims and values, methods, practices, knowledge, and social–institutional aspects. Notably, we found that only three studies mentioned epistemic insights concerning the interplay between scientific knowledge and AI knowledge. Building upon these findings, we propose a unifying framework that can guide future empirical studies, focusing on three key elements: (a) AI’s application in science and (b) the similarities and (c) differences in epistemological approaches between science and AI. We then conclude our study by proposing a development trajectory for K-12 students’ learning of AI-science epistemic insights.<br />","2024-03-15","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","1-31","","","","","Science & Education: Contributions from History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science and Mathematics","Unpacking Epistemic Insights of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Science Education","","","","","","","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Dordrecht Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; Epistemic insights; Family resemblance approach; Science education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare are rapidly evolving, offering promise for enhanced medical decision-making and patient care. In the context of cardiology, the integration of AI promises to provide more efficient and accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies for ASD patients. In interventional cardiology, sometimes the lack of precise measurement of the cardiac rims evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography combined with the floppy aspect of the rims can mislead and result in complications. AI software can be created to generate responses for difficult tasks, like which device is the most suitable for different shapes and dimensions to prevent embolization or erosion. This paper reviews the current state of AI in healthcare and its applications in cardiology, emphasizing the specific opportunities and challenges in applying AI to ASD diagnosis and management. By exploring the capabilities and limitations of AI in ASD diagnosis and management. This paper highlights the evolution of medical practice towards a more AI-augmented future, demonstrating the capacity of AI to unlock new possibilities for healthcare professionals and patients alike.","2024-01-15","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","132","","2","14","","Diagnostics (2075-4418)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: MDPI","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/LNB3GHAU/Cinteza et al. - 2024 - Can Artificial Intelligence Revolutionize the Diag.pdf","","","ARTIFICIAL intelligence; ATRIAL septal defects; DIAGNOSIS; MEDICAL care; MEDICAL personnel; TOOTH erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The launch of the ChatGPT-3 posed great challenges for higher education, given its popularity among university students. The present study aimed to analyze the attitudes of university students toward the use of ChatGPTs in their academic activities. Method: This study was oriented toward a quantitative approach and had a nonexperimental design. An online survey was administered to the 499 participants. Results: The findings of this study revealed a significant association between various factors and attitudes toward the use of the ChatGPT. The higher beta coefficients for responsible use (β=0.806***), the intention to use frequently (β=0.509***), and acceptance (β=0.441***) suggested that these are the strongest predictors of a positive attitude toward ChatGPT. The presence of positive emotions (β=0.418***) also plays a significant role. Conversely, risk (β=-0.104**) and boredom (β=-0.145**) demonstrate a negative yet less decisive influence. These results provide an enhanced understanding of how students perceive and utilize ChatGPTs, supporting a unified theory of user behavior in educational technology contexts. Conclusion: Ease of use, intention to use frequently, acceptance, and intention to verify information influenced the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT responsibly. On the one hand, this study provides suggestions for HEIs to improve their educational curricula to take advantage of the potential benefits of AI and contribute to AI literacy.","2024-05-08","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","1-18","","1","12","","BMC Psychology","Analysis of college students' attitudes toward the use of ChatGPT in their academic activities","","","","","","","eng","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/IEISXAET/Acosta-Enriquez et al. - 2024 - Analysis of college students' attitudes toward the.pdf","","","ARTIFICIAL intelligence; BETA (Finance); BOREDOM; CHATGPT; COLLEGE student attitudes; EDUCATIONAL technology; STUDENT attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about how AI should be taught. In this paper, 46 studies in academic conferences and journals are reviewed to investigate pedagogical strategies, learning tools, assessment methods in AI literacy education in K-12 contexts, and students’ learning outcomes. The investigation reveals that the promotion of AI literacy education has seen significant progress in the past two decades. This highlights that intelligent agents, including Google’s Teachable Machine, Learning ML, and Machine Learning for Kids, are age-appropriate tools for AI literacy education in K-12 contexts. Kindergarten students can benefit from learning tools such as PopBots, while software devices, such as Scratch and Python, which help to develop the computational thinking of AI algorithms, can be introduced to both primary and secondary schools. The research shows that project-based, human–computer collaborative learning and play- and game-based approaches, with constructivist methodologies, have been applied frequently in AI literacy education. Cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes, course satisfaction and soft skills acquisition have been reported. The paper informs educators of appropriate learning tools, pedagogical strategies, assessment methodologies in AI literacy education, and students’ learning outcomes. Research implications and future research directions within the K-12 context are also discussed.<br />","2024-01-06","2024-06-10 06:57:40","2024-06-10 06:57:40","","1-39","","","","","Journal of Computers in Education","Artificial intelligence (AI) learning tools in K-12 education","","","","","","","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Berlin/Heidelberg Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/BQ8FHR7X/Yim and Su - 2024 - Artificial intelligence (AI) learning tools in K-1.pdf","","","AI literacy education; Artificial intelligence literacy; K-12 students; Learning tools; Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

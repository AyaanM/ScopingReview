Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has gained its popularity in online learning environments during the pandemic to assist students’ learning. However, many of these AI tools are new to teachers. They may not have rich technical knowledge to use AI educational applications to facilitate their teaching, not to mention developing students’ AI digital capabilities. As such, there is a growing need for teachers to equip themselves with adequate digital competencies so as to use and teach AI in their teaching environments. There are few existing frameworks informing teachers of necessary AI competencies. This study first explores the opportunities and challenges of employing AI systems and how they can enhance teaching, learning and assessment. Then, aligning with generic digital competency frameworks, the DigCompEdu framework and P21’s framework for twenty-first century learning were adapted and revised to accommodate AI technologies.

It is necessary to clarify the technological affordances and challenges in a normative way to lay the foundation for future development. This study addressed the dearth of literature by performing a systematic review, aiming to (i) explore the utility and availability from the technological affordances perspective; (ii) summarize the current challenges in risks prevention; and (iii) propose possible directions for future research and practice. A total of 27 academic articles published in core journals between 2020 and 2023 were analyzed, and the inductive grounded approach was used to categorize the coding schemes. The findings revealed four technological affordances: accessibility, personalization, automation, and interactivity; and five challenges: academic integrity risk, response errors and bias, over-dependence risk, the widening digital divide, and privacy and security. We propose future directions, encourage educational organizations to formulate guidelines for the ethical use of AI in education, call on educators to embrace future trends in AI education instead of shunning its use, and guide students to treat it as a thought aid and reference, rather than relying on it entirely.","2024-03-01","2024-06-07 05:49:54","2024-06-07 05:49:54","","139-155","","1","44","","Asia Pacific Journal of Education","Critical analysis of the technological affordances, challenges and future directions of Generative AI in education","","","","","","","eng","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd","","","","","Administration of Education Programs; All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction; ARTIFICIAL intelligence in education; EDUCATION associations; EDUCATIONAL planning; Educational Support Services; EDUCATIONAL technology; TEACHER education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These grasps are achieved by dragging the object to the edge of a table, and grasping it from the protruding part, performing so-called slide-to-edge grasps. This type of approach, which uses the environment to facilitate the grasp, is named Environmental Constraint Exploitation (ECE), and has been shown to improve the robustness of grasps while reducing the planning effort. The paper proposes two strategies, namely Continuous Slide and Grasp and Pivot and Re-Grasp, that are designed to deal with different objects. In the first strategy, the hand is positioned over the object and assumed to stick to it during the sliding until the edge, where the fingers wrap around the object and pick it up. In the second strategy, instead, the sliding motion is performed using pivoting, and thus the object is allowed to rotate with respect to the hand that drags it toward the edge. Then, as soon as the object reaches the desired position, the hand detaches from the object and moves to grasp the object from the side. In both strategies, the hand positioning for grasping the object is implemented using a recently proposed functional model for soft hands, the closure signature, whereas the sliding motion on the table is executed by using a hybrid force-velocity controller. We conducted 320 grasping trials with 16 different objects using a soft hand attached to a collaborative robot arm. Experiments showed that the Continuous Slide and Grasp is more suitable for small objects (e.g., a credit card), whereas the Pivot and Re-Grasp performs better with larger objects (e.g., a big book). The gathered data were used to train a classifier that selects the most suitable strategy to use, according to the object size and weight. Implementing ECE strategies with soft hands is a first step toward their use in real-world scenarios, where the environment should be seen more as a help than as a hindrance.","2019","2024-06-07 05:53:22","2024-06-07 05:53:22","","135","","","6","","Front Robot AI","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33501150 PMCID: PMC7805883","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/R9SW7S5Q/Bimbo et al. - 2019 - Exploiting Robot Hand Compliance and Environmental.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501150","","edge grasp; environmental constraints exploitation; grasp planning; sliding; soft robotic hands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, the body uses ETs at several stages in embryonic development, in normal postnatal growth, and in cardiovascular homeostasis under healthy conditions. On the other hand, overwhelming evidence now exists that ET-1 plays important pathophysiological roles in conditions of decompensated vascular homeostasis. Indeed, in CHF this evidence is sufficient to justify the large-scale studies of morbidity and mortality needed to market ET antagonists as medicines. Other potentially important cardiovascular indications for ET antagonists are still emerging--including hypertension, stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage and renal failure--and all are likely to be the subject of clinical trials over the next few years. As yet, there has been little work outside the cardiovascular and renal fields, but other areas, such as cancer treatment, may also prove promising. New molecules with increasing selectivity (ETA and ETB) continue to emerge and may be valuable. Inhibition of ECE-1 remains as an alternative approach and nonpeptide ECE inhibitors now exist. There appears to be a consensus that ETA blockade is beneficial in cardiovascular and renal disease. However, several strands of work presented at the meeting--the hypertensive salt-sensitive phenotype of rescued ETB knockout mice, the sustained and progressive hypertensive effects of ETB-selective antagonism in rats, ETB-mediated vasodilatation and natriuresis in dogs, and nitric oxide-dependent ETB-mediated vasodilatation in humans--all suggest that ETB-mediated vascular and renal responses may be protective. The development of selective ETA antagonists, therefore, now seems fully justified. In the future, direct comparisons in animal models, and patients, of ETA and ETA/B antagonists will be important in determining the value of additional ETB receptor blockade in individual diseases.","1998-01","2024-06-07 05:53:22","2024-06-07 05:53:22","","5-8","","1","19","","Trends Pharmacol Sci","Endothelin","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9509892","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9509892","","Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Cardiovascular Diseases; Endothelin Receptor Antagonists; Endothelin-1; Endothelin-Converting Enzymes; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Lung Diseases; Metalloendopeptidases; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Promoter Regions, Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social media technologies have been documented as low-cost, synchronous, and convenient methods to assist young children, parents, and early childhood (EC) teachers in communication and collaboration. However, few researchers have explored the potential usage of social media tools in enhancing children's physical activities in the early years, particularly during the pandemic period. This article uses the example of WeChat Sports, one of the most famous children's games supported by social media web 2.0, to explore the benefits, challenges, and potentialities of using them in ECE. This research uses semi-structured interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the attitudes and perspectives of EC teachers and parents on the potential usage of social media technologies in supporting children's physical activities. The results reveal that most participants had a good understanding of using scientific methods to assist children's physical development, however, they expressed concerns on children's health, privacy, and formal learning in terms of overexposure to social media technologies. Suggestions and implications are also provided for both social media application developers and educators in future research studies.","2022","2024-06-07 05:53:22","2024-06-07 05:53:22","","321-338","","1","70","","Educ Technol Res Dev","Exploring the adoption of social media in self-paced physical activity in early childhood education","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34785875 PMCID: PMC8582332","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/GEGQUJNM/Lu - 2022 - Exploring the adoption of social media in self-pac.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34785875","","Early childhood education; Quality and equality; Social media technologies; Sustainable development goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in wireless technologies enable remote delivery of light to tumors, but suffer from key limitations, including low levels of tissue penetration and photosensitizer activation. Here, we introduce DeepLabCut (DLC)-informed low-power wireless telemetry with an integrated thermal/light simulation platform that overcomes the above constraints. The simulator produces an optimized combination of wavelengths and light sources, and DLC-assisted wireless telemetry uses the parameters from the simulator to enable adequate illumination of tumors through high-throughput (<20 mice) and multi-wavelength operation. Together, they establish a range of guidelines for effective PDT regimen design. In vivo Hypericin and Foscan mediated PDT, using cancer xenograft models, demonstrates substantial suppression of tumor growth, warranting further investigation in research and/or clinical settings.","2022-04-21","2024-06-07 05:53:22","2024-06-07 05:53:22","","2178","","1","13","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35449140 PMCID: PMC9023557","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/2Z542U62/Kim et al. - 2022 - AI-enabled, implantable, multichannel wireless tel.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35449140","","Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Mice; Neoplasms; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Telemetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little research focuses on AI literacy programs in early childhood education.                                         Objectives               The aim of this mixed‐methods study is to examine the feasibility of an AI literacy program called “AI4KG” and explore how it might affect kindergarteners' perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science.                                         Methods                                A total of 26 child–parent dyads recruited from a Hong Kong kindergarten were involved in this study, consisting of 26 children (                 M                 age                  = 4 years, SD = 0.28) and their parents. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys and interviews designed to explore children's perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science, and parents' perceptions of the AI4KG intervention.                                                        Results               It is found that children have increased their perceptions of robots after the AI literacy program, but the AI4KG curriculum had no significant effects on kindergarten children's engineering and science attitudes. Most parents (22 out of 26) agreed that their children's AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI attitudes have been enhanced after learning through the AI4KG curriculum.                                         Conclusions               This study suggests that the AI4KG curriculum is potentially effective in promoting early AI literacy and favourable attitudes towards the technology, but further research is needed to develop age‐appropriate measures and assess its long‐term impact on children's education and career paths.                        ,              Lay Description                            What is currently known about this topic?                                                                        AI literacy is becoming important as AI transforms society, but few studies have explored AI literacy in early childhood education.                                                           Prior research found AI activities can positively influence older children's views of robots and engineering.

Little research focuses on AI literacy programs in early childhood education.                                         Objectives               The aim of this mixed‐methods study is to examine the feasibility of an AI literacy program called “AI4KG” and explore how it might affect kindergarteners' perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science.                                         Methods                                A total of 26 child–parent dyads recruited from a Hong Kong kindergarten were involved in this study, consisting of 26 children (                 M                 age                  = 4 years, SD = 0.28) and their parents.

Results               It is found that children have increased their perceptions of robots after the AI literacy program, but the AI4KG curriculum had no significant effects on kindergarten children's engineering and science attitudes. Most parents (22 out of 26) agreed that their children's AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI attitudes have been enhanced after learning through the AI4KG curriculum.                                         Conclusions               This study suggests that the AI4KG curriculum is potentially effective in promoting early AI literacy and favourable attitudes towards the technology, but further research is needed to develop age‐appropriate measures and assess its long‐term impact on children's education and career paths.                        ,              Lay Description                            What is currently known about this topic?

The problem is that AI education is new, and we have not understood the competencies required by students to understand AI effectively. Since research in this area is limited and lacking in African settings, this study focused on Nigerian K-12 students to understand the factors that support a proper grasp of AI content in the context. A quantitative methodology approach was utilized with a hardcopy survey administered to secondary school students, which yielded 605 responses. It was found that cognitive, human-tool collaboration, self-learning, skill competence, and ethics significantly influence the content of AI. It was further revealed that no moderating effect was shown while the mediating effect of ethics was significant between cognitive competence and content of AI. Surprisingly, all the propositions made show that only the relationship between teamwork competence and AI course content was not supported. This result suggests a clear need for activities that promotes collaboration in the AI curriculum. This study's findings contribute to the limited evidence on the significance of learners’ competence in understanding AI through the content provided.

Methods In this prospective study, we enrolled patients with prostate cancer (clinical stages cT1c–3, cN0, and cM0) with a positive index lesion at target biopsy, suspicious for capsular contact or extracapsular extension at preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital (Orbassano, Turin, Italy), from December 2020 to December 2021. At the end of extirpative phase, thanks to our new AAR artificial intelligence driven system, the virtual prostate 3D model allowed to identify the tumour's location at the level of the preserved NVB and to perform a selective excisional biopsy, sparing the remaining portion of the bundle. Perioperative and postoperative data were evaluated, especially focusing on the positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, potency, continence recovery, and biochemical recurrence. Results Thirty-four patients were enrolled. In 15 (44.1%) cases, the target lesion was in contact with the prostatic capsule at multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (Wheeler grade L2) while in 19 (55.9%) cases extracapsular extension was detected (Wheeler grade L3). 3D AAR guided biopsies were negative in all pathological tumour stage 2 (pT2) patients while they revealed the presence of cancer in 14 cases in the pT3 cohort (14/16; 87.5%). PSM rates were 0% and 7.1% in the pathological stages pT2 and pT3 (<3 mm, Gleason score 3), respectively. Conclusion With the proposed 3D AAR system, it is possible to correctly identify the lesion's location on the NVB in 87.5% of pT3 patients and perform a 3D-guided tailored nerve-sparing even in locally advanced diseases, without compromising the oncological safety in terms of PSM rates.","2023-10-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:11:33","407-415","","4","10","","Asian Journal of Urology","Three-dimensional automatic artificial intelligence driven augmented-reality selective biopsy during nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy","Robotic surgery in urology: Recent advances","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Prostate cancer; Radical prostatectomy; Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroscientists have been studying mental fatigue for a while. They clearly understand some underlying mechanisms of mental fatigue, such as brain chemistry and neural activity changes. However, defining mental fatigue is still an open research question. Despite this, neuroscience and cognitive psychology has made significant progress in understanding the causes and consequences of mental fatigue. In contrast, computer scientists presumably have a limited understanding of mental fatigue. This lack of understanding leads to inadequate models of mental fatigue in computer science. However, the ever evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) shows a great potential to answer the open challenges in mental fatigue modelling. For instance, AI with fuzzy rules, machine learning or deep learning algorithms, as well as the methods of model explanation can be a valuable tool for creating accurate models of mental fatigue. Artificial intelligence models can learn from large amounts of data and accurately predict mental fatigue. However, modelling efforts are often more focused on acquiring parameters than studying and validating them within the model. Models developed in this way suffer problems with reliability making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of mental fatigue. Therefore, it is essential balance between these parameters’ correct acquisition, validation and interaction to create more accurate models of mental fatigue. In our survey, we have observed that an unspecified modelling impact the model at four scale : experimental design, data acquisition and processing, choice of indicators or parameters and reasoning. We provide some useful guidelines through criticisms for modelling, which would be closer to reality.","2024-01-28","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:11:40","126999","","","567","","Neurocomputing","Artificial intelligence modelling human mental fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Mental fatigue detection; Mental fatigue modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thriving trend has also been seen in medicine in recent years, particularly in the field of imaging. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and their methods (eg, SVM, CNN), as well as radiomics, are the terminologies that have been introduced to this field and, to some extent, become familiar to the expert clinicians. PET is one of the modalities that has been enhanced via these state-of-the-art algorithms. This robust imaging technique further merged with anatomical modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide reliable hybrid modalities, PET/CT and PET/MRI. Applying AI-based algorithms on the different components (PET, CT, and MRI) has resulted in promising results, maximizing the value of PET imaging. However, [18F]F-FDG, the most commonly utilized tracer in molecular imaging, has been mainly in the spotlight. Thus, we aimed to look into the less discussed tracers in this review, moving beyond [18F]F-FDG. The novel non-[18F]F-FDG agents also showed to be valuable in various clinical tasks, including lesion detection and tumor characterization, accurate delineation, and prognostic impact. Regarding prostate patients, PSMA-based models were highly accurate in determining tumoral lesions’ location and delineating them, particularly within the prostate gland. However, they also could assess whole-body images to detect extra-prostatic lesions in a patient automatically. Considering the prognostic value of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET using AI, it could predict response to treatment and patient survival, which are crucial in patient management. Choline imaging, another non-[18F]F-FDG tracer, similarly showed acceptable results that may be of benefit in the clinic, though the current evidence is significantly more limited than PSMA. Lastly, different subtypes of DOTA ligands were found to be valuable. They could diagnose tumoral lesions in challenging sites and even predict histopathology grade, being a highly advantageous noninvasive tool. In conclusion, the current limited investigations have shown promising results, leading us to a bright future for AI in molecular imaging beyond [18F]F-FDG.","2024-01-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:11:42","171-180","","1","54","","Seminars in Nuclear Medicine","Application of Artificial Intelligence in Oncologic Molecular PET-Imaging","Prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early childhood education, which is linked to later achievement, is thus an intervention area of interest. Conceptualizing the potential links between early childhood education and reduced risk for youth firearm homicide is important for guiding policy advocacy and informing future research. Methods This paper presents a conceptual model linking early childhood education to reduced risk for firearm homicide. Each link in the model is discussed, and a corresponding review of the literature is presented. The need for anti-racist policies to strengthen the impact of early childhood education is highlighted. Results Early education and firearm homicide research are each well-established but largely disconnected. There are clear immediate benefits of early childhood education; however, these effects wane with time, particularly for youth of color. At the same time, juvenile delinquency—a major risk factor for firearm homicide—is influenced by educational inequities. Conclusions Effective interventions to reduce firearm homicides among Black male youth in the United States are needed. Early childhood education shows promise as an intervention. However, to have an impact, this education needs to be accessible and affordable for all, particularly families of color and low income. Societal structures and policies must also better support the positive gains seen through early childhood education to avoid dissipation.","2024-04-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:11:45","107917","","","181","","Preventive Medicine","Investing in family-centered early childhood education","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anti-racist policy; Early childhood education; Family supportive policies; Firearm deaths; Homicide; Systemic racism; Youth mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to improve human identification processes, this research offers a novel method that integrates AI and many biometric image sensors. The accuracy, robustness, and susceptibility to spoofing assaults of conventional single-modal biometric systems are among their many drawbacks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a secure multi-biometric system that relies on feature-level fusion to identify users. In the preprocessing step, fingerprint images undergo Min-Max normalization to mitigate variations in image quality. In order to extract high-level features from both raw Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and Min-Max normalized fingerprint images, ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network, is used. These extracted feature vectors are able to distinguish between the two modalities. We proposed boosted Xgboost as a classifier for authentication in the identification steps to improve performance. The proposed approach is simulated using Python. A comparison study for improved Xgboost is presented using measures for accuracy, precision-recall, and F1-Score. Across all comparative metrics, the technique achieves much better performance. According to experimental findings, the suggested multi-biometric systems are more effective, dependable, and robust than the existing multi-biometric authentication systems.","2024-06-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:11:47","101082","","","33","","Measurement: Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Boosted Xgboost, Artificial intelligence (AI); Human Identification; Multi-biometric Image sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-2), though commonly used, relies heavily on comprehensive clinical data and blood samples. This study sought to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model utilizing key hemodynamic parameters to predict ICU mortality within the first 24 h and assess its performance relative to SAPS-2. Methods We conducted an analysis of select hemodynamic parameters and the structure of heart rate curves to identify potential predictors of ICU mortality. A machine-learning model was subsequently trained and validated on distinct patient cohorts. The AI algorithm’s performance was then compared to the SAPS-2, focusing on classification accuracy, calibration, and generalizability. Measurements and main results The study included 1298 ICU admissions from March 27th, 2015, to March 27th, 2017. An additional cohort from 2022 to 2023 comprised 590 patients, resulting in a total dataset of 1888 patients. The observed mortality rate stood at 24.0%. Key determinants of mortality were the Glasgow Coma Scale score, heart rate complexity, patient age, duration of diastolic blood pressure below 50 mmHg, heart rate variability, and specific mean and systolic blood pressure thresholds. The AI model, informed by these determinants, exhibited a performance profile in predicting mortality that was comparable, if not superior, to the SAPS-2. Conclusions The AI model, which integrates heart rate and blood pressure curve analyses with basic clinical parameters, provides a methodological approach to predict in-hospital mortality in ICU patients. This model offers an alternative to existing tools that depend on extensive clinical data and laboratory inputs. Its potential integration into ICU monitoring systems may facilitate more streamlined mortality prediction processes.","2024-02-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:12:04","107934","","","169","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","Heart rate complexity helps mortality prediction in the intensive care unit","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Blood pressure; Complexity; Diastolic blood pressure; Hemodynamic parameters; ICU; Machine learning; Mortality prediction; SAPS-2; Variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its association with LBP-related disability is unknown. In the present study, we aimed to analyze whether ‘Mo-fi-disc’ scoring system could predict LBP-related disability and distinguish patients with LBP from asymptomatic subjects, while the spine medicine marching towards the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Methods This is a cross-sectional analysis of a prospectively collected database. We included age-, gender-, and BMI-matched 132 subjects (patients: 66, asymptomatic subjects: 66). Modic changes (Mo), fatty infiltration in the paraspinal muscles (fi), and intervertebral disc degeneration (disc) were evaluated using ‘Mo-fi-disc’ scoring system on lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging. Pain and disability were evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI), respectively. Results A Mo-fi-disc score of 5.5 was the most appropriate cut-off value. Mo-fi-disc scoring system had an OR of 1.79 in distinguishing patients with LBP from asymptomatic subjects. One point increment in VAS and ODI had ORs of 1.82 and 1.13 for predicting higher Mo-fi-disc scores. Conclusion ‘Mo-fi-disc’ scoring system is a useful tool depicting intensity of LBP and LBP-related disability. The cut off value of Mo-fi-disc score is 5.5 to distinguish patients with LBP from asymptomatic subjects. This scoring system, with progressive improvement of its faults, could help clinicians to select appropriate patients for conservative and surgical management in the very near future, in AI-based spine medicine.

Methods Two convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to predict patient age and sex. Model 1 applied a 5 s sliding time-window, allowing multiple CNN predictions. The consistency of the output values, expressed as interquartile range (IQR), was used to estimate prediction certainty. Model 2 was trained on the full 10s ECG signal, resulting in a single CNN point prediction value. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set and externally validated on the PTB-XL dataset. Results Both CNNs were trained on 269,979 standard 12‑lead ECGs (82,477 patients). Model 1 showed higher accuracy for both age and sex prediction (mean absolute error, MAE 6.9 ± 6.3 years vs. 7.7 ± 6.3 years and AUC 0.946 vs. 0.916, respectively, P < 0.001 for both). The IQR of multiple CNN output values allowed to differentiate between high and low accuracy of ECG based predictions (P < 0.001 for both). Among 10% of patients with narrowest IQR, sex prediction accuracy increased from 65.4% to 99.2%, and MAE of age prediction decreased from 9.7 to 4.1 years compared to the 10% with widest IQR.

Through exploring the conceptual metaphors of AI education for young children with 137 undergraduate students majoring in ECE (early childhood education) at I University in the central part of the United States, this present study tried to figure out the educationally meaningful direction of AI education for young children. The surveys were composed with open questions to find out PEC teachers’ metaphor of AI education for young children and they were distributed to research subjects. Collected data were named, classified, categorised, and finally, 7 categories out of 137 metaphors were analysed through the step of confirming. PEC teachers in this study had positive metaphorical concepts such as ‘possibility of play and experience’', ‘future essentials’, ‘innovation and change’, ‘convenience’, ‘assistant teacher’, and negative metaphorical concepts such as ‘double-sided meaning’, ‘Complexity’ of AI education for young children. PEC teachers’ beliefs about teaching-and-learning theory and methods related to AI education in ECE settings can be an important indicator of what thoughts and attitudes teachers will have when they implement the AI-related curriculum. Therefore, since PEC teachers have direct responsibility of planning and implementing AI education at ECE institutions, their conception of AI education in ECE would provide an important insight for shaping AI education for young children in the future.","2024-03-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:12:37","101455","","","51","","Thinking Skills and Creativity","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence education; Early childhood education; Metaphor analysis; Pre-service teacher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.","2023-05-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:12:43","100520","","","39","","Educational Research Review","Computational thinking in early childhood education","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Computational thinking; Early childhood education; Systematic review; Three-dimensional framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The course was conducted over five semesters at a U.S. research institution, with 153 participating students. Data were collected using diverse methods, including formative and summative assessments, surveys of learning gains, focus group interviews, and analysis of capstone project process videos. The course design included Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) tailored to meet the requirements of contemporary AI/CV professionals, weekly AI-based curricular modules, unrestricted access to computational resources, and diverse assessment strategies. This study also delves into students’ perceptions of this unique learning approach and challenges, with students from varied academic majors.

This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world.","2022-01-01","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:03","2024-06-07 06:13:00","100061","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","Artificial Intelligence education for young children","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","AI literacy; Artificial intelligence education; Digital equity; Early childhood education; Pedagogical considerations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The country’s regional influence, burgeoning AI industry and ambitious governmental initiatives around AI make it an important jurisdiction to consider, regardless of where the reader of this article lives. Even as existing policy processes intend to encourage the rapid development of AI for economic growth and social good, an overarching trend persists in India, and several other jurisdictions: the limitations and risks of data-driven decisions still feature as retrospective considerations for development and deployment of AI applications. This article argues that the technical limitations of AI systems should be reckoned with at the time of developing policy, and the societal and ethical concerns that arise due to such limitations should be used to inform what policy processes aspire to achieve. It proposes a framework for such deliberation to occur, by analysing the three main stages of bringing machine learning (the most popular subset of AI techniques) to deployment—the data, model and application stage. It is written against the backdrop of India’s current AI policy landscape, and applies the proposed framework to ongoing sectoral challenges in India. With a view to influence existing policy deliberation in the country, it focuses on potential risks that arise from data-driven decisions in general, and in the Indian context in particular.

It draws from the data of four recent studies to demonstrate pedagogical practices informed by Indigenous (Māori) perspectives. Māori values, such as manaakitanga (caring, hospitality, generosity) and whanaungatanga (relatedness), are shown featuring in routines focused on provision of food and serving as a key focus of early childhood education for sustainability. It is argued that providing opportunities for children to become engaged with growing, cooking and sharing food enables them to operationalise compassion towards themselves, others and the environment, reconnecting with the source of their food and demonstrating generosity and care to others (both human and more-than-human) in their communities. This can be viewed as a pedagogical response to the increasing encroachment of neoliberalism, with its incumbent individualism and lack of collectivist consciousness or concern for the environment, into education settings. Furthermore, drawing upon Indigenous perspectives honours traditional, localised wisdom regarding sustainability practices.","2015","2024-06-07 06:14:09","2024-06-07 06:14:09","2024-06-07 06:13:59","74-85","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, arrangements that are suited to meet families' specific needs and preferences are sometimes in tension with experts' definitions of ""quality."" Researchers and policymakers increasingly emphasize that educational goals cannot be met until this tension is reconciled. I offer new institutionalism as a conceptual framework for these emerging conversations and propose two ideal-typical institutional logics: the logic of the family and the logic of education. This perspective emphasizes that different expectations and goals are related to individuals' differing social and institutional locations. Secondary analyses of the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) data offer preliminary empirical evidence.","2016","2024-06-07 06:14:09","2024-06-07 06:14:09","2024-06-07 06:14:06","673-707","","3","53","","","Education Versus Family","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [American Educational Research Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.","2020","2024-06-04 07:35:31","2024-06-04 07:35:31","2024-06-04 07:35:31","75264-75278","","","8","","","Artificial Intelligence in Education","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","/Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/9IET9KZ8/Chen et al. - 2020 - Artificial Intelligence in Education A Review.pdf","","","artificial intelligence; Education; leaner; Learning (artificial intelligence); Microcomputers; Robots; Technological innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A particularly groundbreaking development is the emergence of humanoid AI robots, which holds immense promise for enhancing children’s learning experiences during early childhood. Unlike other forms of AI, humanoid AI robots bear a closer resemblance to humans, making them more approachable and engaging for young children. This paper explores a practical framework for incorporating humanoid AI robots into early childhood education. This framework includes several key components: first, introducing AI concepts in a child-friendly manner; second, fostering a relationship between children and AI; third, designing developmentally appropriate activities facilitated by AI; and finally, addressing the challenges associated with integrating AI into early childhood classrooms.

This study proposes and validates a comprehensive AI literacy assessment tool (AI4KGA) for kindergarten children. The research involved 215 children and 19 experts. The validity and reliability of the AI4KG assessment were evaluated by experts, with Cronbach’s α and Item Response Theory approach. The results demonstrated that the AI literacy assessment (AI4KGA) was valid and reliable. We also found that younger children scored lower on the AI literacy assessment than older children and girls demonstrated a slightly higher AI literacy score than boys after they completed the AI4KG curriculum. The AI4KGA has potential applications for various stakeholders, such as policymakers, educators, instructional designers, researchers, and educational institutions. The findings suggest that the AI4KGA can evaluate children’s learning outcomes in terms of AI literacy. Overall, this research contributes to developing AI literacy assessment in kindergarten children and advancing AI literacy education.","2024-05-04","2024-06-05 12:01:13","2024-06-05 12:01:14","","1-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Place: New York Publisher: Springer US","","","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssjs&AN=edssjs.1F37914&site=eds-live&custid=s4575703&scope=cite","","Early childhood education; AI literacy; AI literacy education; AI literacy assessment; AI4KGA; Kindergarten children; Validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is critical to understand the challenges and enablers associated with promoting AI literacy and perceptions in kindergartens needs to be further researched and evaluated. This study aims to identify teachers’ views on the importance of AI literacy in kindergartens and the challenges and enablers of promoting AI literacy in kindergartens. Data was collected from 15 teachers through individual interviews. It was found that the four main challenges of promoting AI literacy in kindergarten classrooms, including lack of school support, lack of children’s comprehensive ability, insufficient teacher knowledge of AI, and lack of curriculum guidelines. The three main enablers of promoting AI literacy in kindergarten classrooms are government support, school support, and social needs. We also found that more than half of teachers in this study considered AI literacy education is crucial for kindergarten children.

However, more research must examine how teachers and educators perceive and experience these AI systems when implemented. Objectives: The first objective was to investigate informants' perceptions and experiences of AI-empowered interventions for children with autism. Mainly, it explores the informants' perceived benefits and challenges of using AI-empowered interventions and their recommendations for avoiding the perceived challenges. Methodology: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used. Twenty educators and parents with experience implementing AI interventions for autism were recruited through purposive sampling. Semi-structured and focus group interviews conducted, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: The analysis identified four major themes: perceived benefits of AI interventions, implementation challenges, needed support, and recommendations for improvement. Benefits included increased engagement and personalized learning. Challenges included technology issues, training needs, and data privacy concerns. Conclusions: AI-powered interventions show potential to improve autism support, but significant challenges must be addressed to ensure effective implementation from an educator's perspective. The benefits of personalized learning and student engagement demonstrate the potential value of these technologies. However, with adequate training, technical support, and measures to ensure data privacy, many educators will likely find integrating AI systems into their daily practices easier. Implications: To realize the full benefits of AI for autism, developers must work closely with educators to understand their needs, optimize implementation, and build trust through transparent privacy policies and procedures. With proper support, AI interventions can transform how autistic individuals are educated by tailoring instruction to each student's unique profile and needs.","2024-04-11","2024-06-05 12:01:13","2024-06-05 12:01:15","","1-12","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","; /Users/ayaan/Zotero/storage/W557H2GK/Li et al. - 2024 - Teachers and educators' experiences and perception.pdf","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edb&AN=176562725&site=eds-live&custid=s4575703&scope=cite","","Artificial intelligence; AI-empowered interventions; AUTISM; AUTISM in children; AUTISTIC children; Children with autism; DATA privacy; Educators; INDIVIDUALIZED instruction; INTERNET privacy; Parents; TEACHER educators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
